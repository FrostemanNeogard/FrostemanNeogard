# Liam Frosteman Neogard

Software engineer by day, and software engineer by night, too.

Creator of the "[Tekken Framedata Bot](https://github.com/FrostemanNeogard/TekkenFramedataBot)" Discord bot among other things.

I like to play around with all kinds of tech and code all kinds of projects. Developing software, creating games, reverse engineering, and hardware repair is what I spend most of my spare time on.

I am currently looking for a new position as a software engineer, so please feel free to contact me if you might know someone who's interested!

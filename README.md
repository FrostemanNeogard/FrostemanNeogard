## About me
**Self taught, disciplined, and motivated.** I've been learning frontend development during my free time for the better part of four years and it has become one of my main hobbbies and has led me to a career in web development. Nothing quite excites me the way learning a new React hook or CSS selector does. As a very technical person, I excel at creating fleshed out, highly functional applications with re-usable components that are a joy to code with. I also have a creative side which excels at writing flashy, solid styling with either SASS or vanilla CSS.
